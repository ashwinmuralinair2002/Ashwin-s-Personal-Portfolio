My Daily Routine
I start my day at 6:15 AM with a refreshing morning routine — I wake up, brush my teeth, take a bath, and iron my shirt. These small steps help me feel clean, organized, and ready for the day ahead.

By 7:00 AM, I have a simple breakfast to energize me — something light but nutritious. At 7:15 AM, I leave home and catch my bus to Kinfra IT Park at 7:30 AM, enjoying a quiet ride that helps me mentally prepare for the day.

I reach the office by 8:45 AM and punch in. Around 9:00 AM, I ease into work by revising the previous day's lessons, which helps me stay consistent with learning. By 9:15 AM, I dive into my main tasks.

At 11:00 AM, I take a short tea break to recharge. By 11:15 AM, I’m back at my desk, continuing my work with renewed focus.

Lunch is at 2:15 PM, usually something light to avoid feeling sluggish. I return by 2:45 PM and get back to completing my daily work tasks.

After wrapping up at 5:30 PM, I head home and reach by 7:45 PM. This marks the beginning of my evening routine.

By 8:00 PM, I do some fitness training — a great way to release stress and stay healthy. Dinner is at 9:00 PM, followed by a short scroll through Instagram at 9:30 PM — my way to unwind a bit.

Finally, I go to bed at 10:00 PM, giving myself enough time to rest and recharge for the next day.
